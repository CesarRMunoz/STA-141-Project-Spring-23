# Decipering Rodent Learning Using a Logistic Regression Model

## Description
This project uses a data set from researchers who studied mice's brain activity. The study flashed a light on either side of a mouse's face, and the mouse was required to spin a wheel in the direction they saw the light. This project used a logistic regression model to predict if the mouse would turn the wheel in the correct direction.

This project aims to determine if the mice learned over time. If the model shows the mice were more likely to spin the wheel in the correct direction as they repeated the trial, this suggests the mice learned from their previous attempts.

## Installation
### Prerequisites
- This project was completed in R version 4.3.0.
- I am uncertain how this will run on past or future versions of R.
### Installation Steps
1. Download the 'STA 141a - Project markdown.RMD' file
2. Run in R and knit to a markdown.
3. Alternatively, the 'Completed-Project-markdown-STA-141a.HTML' is the knitted file, and can be viewed after downloading.
